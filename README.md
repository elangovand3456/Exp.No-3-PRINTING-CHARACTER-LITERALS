# Exp.No-3-PRINTING-CHARACTER-LITERALS
### AIM
To write a python program for printing the character literals.
### ALGORITHM

Step 1:	 Begin the program.
Step 2:	 Define the characters 'S' and 'k' using character literals.
Step 3:	 Use the print() function to display the characters 'S' and 'k'.
Step 4:	 Terminate the program.
### PROGRAM
char1 = 'S'  
char2 = 'k'  
print(char1)
print(char2)
### OUTPUT
